We seek to identify the parts of COVID’s **antigen** protein that stimulate an immune response in the body. These specific regions are known as **B Cell** **epitopes**, and predicting their **protein sequence** is useful in the design and development of vaccines. These regions may induce an immune response in the human body capable of combating the coronavirus. A successful immune response from a vaccine that uses the designed B-cell will produce large amounts of antigen-specific antibodies. We would like to discover particular characteristics of a whole **antigen** protein in addition to the **target sequence**. A “vaccine” is simply a substance that can induce specific **antibodies** and that mimics the structure and function of an epitope.    
In the dataset, pieces of peptide taken from parent proteins are applied to B cell culture, and we want to predict whether each piece of peptide will introduce a specific antibody on the surface of the B cell. The dataset contains features of the peptide and its parent protein, and the label whether antibody is introduced on the surface of B-cell.
